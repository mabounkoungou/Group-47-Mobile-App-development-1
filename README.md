A newsapp called NEWSFEED

APPFUNCTION:

1. The app launches and displays the main activity.
2. The main activity sets up the layout, including a toolbar and a navigation drawer.
3. The toolbar serves as the app's action bar, providing a title and an optional settings menu item.
4. The navigation drawer can be opened and closed by swiping from the left edge of the screen or tapping the hamburger icon on the toolbar.
5. The navigation drawer contains a list of menu items, representing different sections of the app.
6. When a menu item is selected from the navigation drawer, the app switches to the corresponding section.
7. The main activity includes a ViewPager, which allows the user to swipe horizontally between fragments representing different content categories.
8. The TabLayout is used to display tabs at the top of the screen, indicating the currently selected content category.
9. Each fragment corresponds to a specific content category, such as home, world, science, sport, environment, society, fashion, business, or culture.
10. Swiping between fragments updates the selected tab and switches the displayed content.
11. Selecting a menu item in the navigation drawer also updates the currently displayed fragment and tab.
12. The app includes a SettingsActivity, which can be accessed by selecting the settings menu item from the toolbar.
13. When the settings menu item is clicked, the app starts the SettingsActivity.
14. The SettingsActivity likely contains additional settings and preferences that the user can configure.
15. The app handles back button presses, closing the navigation drawer if it's open, or performing the default back button behavior if the drawer is closed.
16. The app provides a consistent user interface for navigating between different sections of content and accessing app settings.
